# WordPress Pages

### What is a page?
A page is the basic location for a majority of the information on the marketing website. For example, for information about mission trips, you can go to [www.thecgcs.org/trips](thecgcs.org/trips). This will take you to the page that discusses mission trip information, application processes, and FAQs. There are also posts. This kind of "page" deals with our blog and has a separate location in the left task bar when in the administrative side of WordPress.

### What can I do on a page?
On a page, you can insert text, photos, videos, links, forms, graphics, and more. You can design the page in any way that you want through the use of layout blocks. Different blocks include Call to Action, centered content, featured posts, hero, image content, posts, staff block, testimonials block, and the wysiwyg block. Each of these blocks are different and input a different template onto your page. Learning what each of these blocks do is a valuable process in learning WordPress. I will not explain them all here. Feel free to create a new private page and play around with the different styles and layouts to produce exactly what you want.

### Page Creation Process
* Add New Page
* Add title
* Add layouts
* Choose visibility: Private or Public
* Choose permalink
* Publish by clicking the publish button in the top right corner

### What do you mean by private or public?
A page that you create can either be private or public. A public page can be viewed by anyone through your website and is open to all people. A private page can be viewed only by administrators. This page is not public on the site, but it is published and can be viewed like a publicly published page by any administrator or editor. A page can also be password protected, which allows only those with the password to view the page.

To publicly access a page, visitors have to either know the permalink, or be provided a link by email or by clicking a button that is on the website. For example, mission trip application pages are published, but aren't typically anchored on a main page. To access these applications, we normally link this in a button on the trips page.
