      * People isolated, transient, and busy.
   * Church
      * We don't really train people to embrace their role as a priest.

   1. Abiding with Christ
   2. Evangelism (entry and Gospel)
* Sleep where they sleep and walk where they walk. Do life with them.
* Saved us from sin and for a purpose.
