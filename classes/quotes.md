### Dr. Robinson
* A truth discovered is more compelling than a truth told.
* I realized that I needed to learn to ride the rhythms of Wake Forest and not create new things for non-believers to try and come to.
   * Asking people who are far from God to break their rhythms and come to our "thing."
* The person who controls the questions controls the direction of the conversation.
* The moment you win an argument, you lose the person. (EV context)

### Dr. Hambrick
* Counseling is only as effective as you are honest.
* We don't know what we know.
* You don't want to be self-centered in a way that you disclose a selfish act.
   * This is why false love and true betrayal can be studied in tandem.
* You are never more free than you are honest.
* I need to protect my wife from others, but also from MYSELF. My harsh words will hurt more than anyone else's. Good word here.
