We are currently developing the web resources for onboarding churches into the Sending Pathways initiative. Soon, we hope to provide a clear way to assess a church's current practices related to sending, craft a custom plan for developing a robust sending culture within a congregation, and implement new processes to center a church around this mission.

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://ubahouston.org).
