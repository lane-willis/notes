## Notes - Adultery and Sexual Addiction
* See *False Love* and *True Betrayal* for more information.

### Conference and Critique aside to start class
* The longer you are in ministry, the more you go to conferences for the people not the content.

### ***Journey from Lust to Adultery
* Matthew 5:27 - 30 reference
   * Referencing lust to adultery here.
   * Plucking eye and cutting hand is hyperbole, but the connection between lust and adultery is not. There is a connection there.
Clarification: This progression is NOT meant to imply that this is the universal developmental cycle of sexual sin.
* There is adultery that did not begin with pornography. Pornography does not necessarily lead to adultery. The purpose of the progression is to provide the rationale for why Jesus would teach that to look at someone with lustful intent is a form of or seed for adultery. This should be a sobering reflection on my sin and the depravity that is here.
* This is not a male only problem.

#### ***Lust to Adultery
1. Objectifying a person: Reducing people to a certain set of appealing features and measuring people's value by how much they please you.
2. Public visual lust: Using the objectification above as a scoring system and savoring actual people.
   * Need to see people as whose image they are made in, whose they are, and what God has for them.
3. Private Narrative lust: Allowing the scoring system to develop into a story in which you interact with someone in your imagination.
   * You can watch the weather pornographically.
4. "Soft" Porn: Using print, television, or internet to provide more "choice" but non-nude objects of lust and imagination.
   * "How far is too far" is the colloquial here. Not what we should be thinking. Need to run away. Much more about motive than activity.
5. Full Porn: Pursuing nude images and videos on the internet or other media forms and having the imagination expanded by professional "story tellers." The frequency, duration, and perversion of this activity can vary.
   * Professionals here. Think about professional ball players. Not synonymous, but can be thought of at some point this way. They have "mastered" their craft.
6. Interaction with a real, anonymous person: The other participant in the story becomes a real person with a real voice and a free will. This can be 1 (900) numbers, provocative chat rooms, strip club, or "sexting".
   * Before this point, everything is static. When you get here, there is more real time interaction.
   * Still entertainment purposes here.
7. Emotional relationship with a known person without touch: no longer is the other real person unknown. Thye have a real name, face, and history. They know your real name, face, and history.
   * This is more than a casual dating relationship. Early stages here.
8. Emotional affair with touch, without sex: This is probably the rarest item on the list, although it is frequently said to exist. This is a relatoinship with a real person with kissing, caressing, fondling, and other non-intercourse affections.
   * Frequently where things come to the office.
   * "We don't know what we know." It's annoying. Rarely is the first news all the news. We don't need to fix something we haven't assessed.
   * We are at the discovery phase, not the disclosure phase.
      * Do I get more than I already knew when I ask a question? If yes, disclosure.
9. One Time Sexual Affair: Now the intercourse barrier has been crossed, but (as in the case of a prostitute or drunken business trip fling) the relational connection may be low.
10. Affair in connected relationship: In terms of marital threat, the sexual affair is now secondary to the deepening "love" between the spouse and adultery partner. Sex is no longer a mere expression of passion, but also devotion.
11. Affair as Pseudo-Spouse/Leaving: No longer is the faithful spouse making the decision regarding divorce. The unfaithful spouse is the active party seeking to dissolve the marriage in order to pursue their adultery partner.

* Rarely does someone jump from 1 to 11. There are incremental steps that occur and need to be assessed.
* Am I being honest? Have I been as honest with my pastor as I have been with a counselor? (Public sermons to private advice also a long way from each other).
* When you are carrying a secret, you are not able to have vulnerable closeness with each other. How much does what you don't know impact what you just said?
* Is there an addiction quality to an affair? Or is there something broken in the marriage?
    * Not a one-size fits all answer here. Probably a both and here. Don't really ever want to blame the marriage though for the affiar. This does not explain or excuse adultery.


### Lust and Lying
* Two sides of the same coin.
* There is no "protecting from the truth."
   * Numbers 32:23, Luke 8:17, Hebrews 4:13
* It isn't the adultery that kills the relationship, it is the LYING.

#### 12 Types of Lying (No Asterisks)
1. Changing Facts: This is the heading under which all "active lying" falls. Here the story is true, but key pieces of the story are changed.
2. Omitting Facts: This is the heading under which all "passive lying" falls. Here the story is true, but there are "dark spots" in the story. Often people who "omit facts" get defensive when they are called liars. But omission of known, important facts is lying.
3. False "Facts": This is a step beyond changing facts. It involves making up an entire scenario and is a step away form a double life (lying type 5). Lying of this type is hard to pull off and requires more elaborate efforts to support the false facts.
4. False Emotion: Now you have to play the part. If your lies are true, they require certain emotions. If you are going to remain "free," then you must become an actor.
   * Getting into the scenario.
5. False "Story": False facts produce false emotions. Together they require a false story. Your lies are starting to create their own world in which they could be true. You are forced to try to live between these two worlds' reality won't bend and your lies can't break without you being found out.
6. Minimizing: Maybe you are "smart enough" not to take the false route. You talk about "just porn" or being "just friends." Or, you talk about sexual sin in coded language such as a "slip" or having a "bad day." Minimizing is one of the more popular methods of lying (to others and to yourself) about sexual sin.
