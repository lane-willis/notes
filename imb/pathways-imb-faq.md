### Do I have to apply for the IMB to participate?
No. There are many reasons why someone would consider being a part of one of these cohorts without planning to serve with the IMB at the present time.

In the case of someone who wants to be a part of a  Pathways » IMB cohort but does not want to apply to the IMB at that time, they can simply participate without doing the application portion of the cohort.
