## Burnout and Self-Care

### Common Ministry Landmines from the Life of Moses
* Mostly sermon-like style. An example of a biblical counseling informed sermon.
Watching the End of the Movie without watching the Movie Example
**Numbers 20:1-13**
If we just take Numbers 20 by itself, we can often feel like the movie example above.

#### A Walk Through Moses' Life
* Exodus 1:15-16, 2:1-2 - Moses' family took great risk to protect beloved and attractive son.
* Exodus 2:3-10 - God allows his mother to raise Moses in Pharaoh's house.
* Acts 7:22 - Moses mastered the Egyptian education system. He stood out.
* Exodus 2:11-22 - Moses kills a man, runs for his life, marries, has children, and herds sheep in the desert. (First time we see Moses' temper).
   * Dr. Hambrick talked about the kind of thing that could derail our ministry. Odds are we know it already. I know the kinds of thing my flesh is prone to do. This is true.
* Exodus 3:1-15 - God speaks to Moses at the burning bush. "I heard the cries of my people."
* Exodus 4: God gives Moses confirmation signs; Moses is fearful and offers excuses; Moses takes his wife and children to Egypt to follow God's plan. No longer eloquent example.
   * Discussion of staff. Hitting the rock and being careless with it. Example of vintage wood bat and hitting rocks with it.
* Exodus 5:1-9 - Moses is rejected by Pharaoh
* Exodus 6:1-13 - God encourages Moses; the people grumble
* Exodus 7-12 - the 10 plagues. Knocking down Egyptian deities.
* Exodus 13-14 - God delivers Israel from Egypt and parts the red sea, providing plunder, and destroying the Egyptian army
* Exodus 15:22-24 and 16:1-3 - the people grumble and God provides manna
* Exodus 17:1-7 - the people grumble and God provides water from a rock.
* Exodus 18:13-23 - Moses is administratively overwhelmed because he is trying to do everything and gets delegation advice from his father-in-law.
* Exodus 20 - Moses receives the 10 commandments.
* Exodus 25-31 - Moses receives instructions regarding the tabernacle.
* Exodus 32:25-35 - Moses has to rebuke Aaron for making the golden calf.
   * Loss of trust in his number 2.
* Numbers 12:1-9 - Aaron and Miriam get jealous of Moses' leadership
* Numbers 16 - Moses faces the rebellion of Korah (people being nasty.)

#### A Second Glance at Numbers 20
1. Moses grew comfortable, casual, and finally aggressive with the things you used to hold with humility, fear, and integrity.
2. Moses made the moment about himself. Anger has a propensity to be highly self-centered and has a gravity that attracts all "similar" negative memories.
3. Moses forgot he was there to lead a people for God. The people would not stand a chance in the idol-infested promise land if they interpreted this moment as a failure of Moses.
4. Moses' life was not a failure (Hebrews 11:23-28). Moses' life was about much more than his story, so his failure bore consequences larger than we might feel fair. How do we respond to our failures? - Need to turn to the Lord. May even need to step aside if disqualified.

### ***Self-Care is Not the Same as Being Selfish

#### 3 Metaphors
1. Oil Change
    * When you get an oil change and do basic maintenance, the vehicle last longer. To not do this, it saves you money in the short-term, but costs you more in the long term.
    * You may get more done in a week, but in 5 years you crash.
2. Airplane Instructions
   * Oxygen mask instructions. Put on your own mask first before placing it upon your traveling partner. Is this rude or selfish? No. We want you to be aware. If you pass out, then a mask isn't going on them or you.
3. Enjoying Art
   * Good art helps you see things differently, from different angles. This helps you attach significance, mood, emotion, or meaning to things that would otherwise get glossed over.

#### 3 Summary Principles
1. Self-care, like an oil change, increases the **longevity** of our ability to love God and love others.
2. Self-care, like airpline instructions, increases our **availability** to love God and love others.
3. Self-care, like enjoying art, increases the **capacities** with which we can love God and love others.

#### Contrast with Selfishness
1. Selfishness does not care about the longevity, availability, or capacity to love God and love others.
2. Selfishness focuses on the optimal enjoyment of one's own life to the neglect of loving God and others.

#### Theological Foundation
* There is a theological point that needs more attention if we are going to engage this question well; namely we are embodied souls. Our bodies have strong influence over our souls. When we neglect our bodies, it becomes more difficult to express the virtues our Christian souls want to express. Jesus acknowledged as much when he said to his sleepy disciples that the spirit is willing, but your flesh is weak in Matthew 26:41.
* If we allow our bodies to deteriorate we will begin to notice diminishing returns in ministry and effectiveness. The longer we are in a place, the more returns we might get.
