### Dr. Robinson
* A truth discovered is more compelling than a truth told.
* I realized that I needed to learn to ride the rhythms of Wake Forest and not create new things for non-believers to try and come to.
   * Asking people who are far from God to break their rhythms and come to our "thing."
* The person who controls the questions controls the direction of the conversation.
* The moment you win an argument, you lose the person. (EV context)
* You don't learn healthy ecclesiology and then plant a healthy church.
* You will never get ahead of the growth until you learn to plan ahead for the growth that is coming.
* If you are going to reach people far from God, you need to need them also.
* Alter one thing at a time when CP. Then you will have a better idea of what got a movement going.

### Dr. Hambrick
* Counseling is only as effective as you are honest.
* We don't know what we know.
* You don't want to be self-centered in a way that you disclose a selfish act.
   * This is why false love and true betrayal can be studied in tandem.
* You are never more free than you are honest.
* I need to protect my wife from others, but also from MYSELF. My harsh words will hurt more than anyone else's. Good word here.
* We get into trouble when we teach gender by stereotype. This doesn't serve us well.
* If you want to make public statements, you need to be informed.
* Part of humility is a willingness to listen, being unoffended by conversation, and caring well in conversation.
* The greatest tool I have in the discipleship of my children as a dad is my failures. Do I own them? Do I repent? Do I repent in a way that is not blame-shifting or minimizing? "I was wrong."
* If busy seasons keep backing up on one another, don't call it busy seasons, but call it a busy lifestyle.
* A failure to plan in somebody else's life does not make a crisis in my life.
