## Notes

### Evangelistic Discovery Bible Studies

#### Look Back
1. The gospel is the **true story of the whole world**, not just a list of propositions.
   * According to the Scriptures.
   * 1 Corinthians 15:1-6
2. Jesus shared the gospel in the context of the whole **grand narrative** following his resurrection.
   * Beginning with Moses
   * Luke 24:13-35
3. The gospel is **exclusive, contextual, central,** and our **priority.**
   * We tend to make people big and God small. (Pluralism)
   * The exclusivity of this message should breed compassion and gratitude.

#### Look Up
* Stats
   * Over 60% of people are open to hearing what the Bible says. (Barna study)
   * 60 or 70% are resistant to going to church though. Crazy.
   * Study on beliefs about the Bible - 55% believe the Bible is the Word of God.
   * 50% of people think the Bible is relevant for life.
* Evangelistic DBS move the focus to what the Scripture says about the gospel as the basis for our response.
   * Ethiopian Eunuch is an example of a DBS.
   * Acts 8:26-40, Isaiah 56:3-6.
   * This kind of DBS give you the opportunity to model basic hermeneutical principles.
* SWORD Method
   * Sin: What is it that defames God's character? Not just the action. But in relationship to God. What are they doing to dishonor God?
