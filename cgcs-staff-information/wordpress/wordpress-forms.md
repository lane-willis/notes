# WordPress Forms

### Forms... Isn't WordPress a website builder?
Why yes. WordPress is a website builder. However, WordPress also has an in-house plugin called 'Gravity Forms.' The CGCS has decided to utilize Gravity Forms as its form software. There are many reasons for this, but the main one is that it is free! Well, somewhat. Gravity Forms comes with our WordPress subscription that we have through the school. This gives us access to everything that Gravity Forms does on the WordPress end.

### Creating Forms
To create a new form, there are multiple options. First, you can click on new form in the left tool bar after clicking on Gravity Forms. A second option is to clikc the add new button that is blue in the middle of the page. You can then create a new form by utilizing a template or start from scratch. After creating a new form, the process is pretty intuitive when adding fields and changing the settings. Gravity Forms is pretty simple to work with in this regard. It also has conditional logic and field styling built in for you that is simple to change.

### Form Settings
Form settings include a title, description, form layouts, and more. On this tab you can set a number of entries that are allowed and also set a schedule for when the form will be open. This sets an open date and a close date, as well as a time. You can also create entry reached messages and form pending/expired messages. Also on this page, you can choose how the form will react to spam and to transitions.

### Form Confirmations
The form confirmations tab is what the person filling out the form will either receive on screen or be directed toward after submitting. You can choose for the applicant to receive text on the screen, be directed to a page on your site, or redirect to a unique URL. Most mission trip applications redirect applicants to a donation page. This is so the applicant can pay their deposit at the time of their application.

### Form Notifications
The form notifications tab is where you will designate who will receive an email notification that the form has been completed. You can do this by creating multiple different notification pages or put multiple emails on one notification. On the notification page you will create the title of the email, choose who you want to send the email to, add a from email and a reply to email, add the subject, and designate the message that the notification will send. You can also add conditional logic to these notifications and choose which fields you want to send to the individual users. You can shape these messages any way you want!

### HubSpot Migration
The HubSpot tab on forms enables us to migrate information from a form submission directly over to HubSpot. You can create as many of these for a form that you want. You do not have to migrate the whole form. You can choose which fields you want to migrate and what processees you want to follow when migrating. You can choose to only update contacts or create new contacts when migrating.

### Exporting Entries
There are multiple ways to export entries from Gravity Forms. The first is to click the import/export button in the left-hand tool bar when in Gravity Forms. You then choose export entries. After this, you would select a form. The form fields will then populate and you will select which form fields you desire to export. You can also add conditional logic and date ranges to further direct your export search. If no date is given, you will export all entries. This way exports the entries as a .csv which can open in Excel and then needs to be saved as an Excel file.

A second way to export entries is to be on the form you want exported. You will then select the GravityExport Lite under the form settings. After doing so, you will click the button 'enable download URL'. This will reload the page and populate different options to export the entries through a download URL. You can choose a date range, file type, and custom filename when downloading. You can then send this link to others and allow them to download the information. This only works if the everyone can download feature is turned on. You can also choose the fields you want to include and how you want the entries ordered on the export sheet. Overall, this looks like to be a better way to export entries.
