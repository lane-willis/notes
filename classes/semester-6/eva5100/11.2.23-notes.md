### Halloween Event

* Discuss genesis of Halloween event, utilizing rhythms that are already ongoing to do ministry instead of adding events or trying to break up rhythms of people far from God.
* 1250 kids that came through. Gave out cards to watch the Story video.
   * 45 already watched the video.
* Allowed those who were present to share.
   * People were so appreciative of free hot chocolate and coffee.
   * Why coffee and hot chocolate? I need to do something to draw the adults in.
   * Parents getting the coffee and hot chocolate. Two lines.
