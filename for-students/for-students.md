Welcome to the Student home page! This space is a repository for our students here at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. This page will hold information on mission trips, documentation, and more.

## Equipping Portal
In this section, we desire that the site itself become a tool for students to utilize alongside their studies, as well as facilitate missional involvement in the community. Our goal is to provide a central location for students to come to when they are seeking to fulfill the Great Commission.

This will not be the place where we advertise or promote the CGCS. You can find that information on [the main website](https://thecgcs.org/trips).

Feel free to check back on this page at a later date. If you would like to contact us directly, feel free to do so at [our main website](https://thecgcs.org/contact/).
