# Lane's Notes

Welcome to my note-taking library. I have decided to begin taking notes using GitHub. Doing this allows me to escape from Microsoft and Google. I know that my notes will now be public, but I prefer this to having to deal with subscriptions and accounts and more!

If you have discovered my site, enjoy peddling around and looking through what I have been learning about!
