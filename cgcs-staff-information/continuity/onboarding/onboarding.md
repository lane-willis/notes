# Welcome to the CGCS!
Congratulations on joining the Center for Great Commission Studies. As the missions hub of Southeastern, our office is devoted to mobilizing and equipping students, faculty, and staff to fulfill the Great Commission. The name of the game around here is mobilization and we do that in many ways. On this site, you will find information about the CGCS, our partnerships, our office and more.

One point of note before you whisk off. The staff page is hidden to the general public and if you click on the left navigation bar, you will not be able to navigate back to this page or the other staff pages without following a link. So, be sure to bookmark this page, as well as missions.center/staff. This is the home page for our staff information!

We are so glad you are here! You may now begin your onboarding process!
