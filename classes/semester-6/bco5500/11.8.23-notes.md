## Notes Same Sex Attraction and Gender Dysphoria

### Sexual Disciples
1. Every person we disciple is gendered and experiences some form of sexual desire.
   1. We are gendered and sexual beings.
      * Genesis 1:27-28
      * Don't teach gender by stereotype. We make too many generalizations.
2. God created gender and sexuality. He declared them good.
   * Genesis 1:31
3. The Fall effects both our personal and cultural experience of gender and sexuality.
   * Romans 8:22-23
4. Any discipleship that does not address our struggles as gendered, sexual beings will be incomplete. (Holistic Discipleship)
   * 2 Corinthians 5:17 - We are new creations! Yet, we are new creations with a history. Needs to be addressed. Our habits and personalities don't evaporate.
   * Our sins and difficulties won't just be left behind when we are saved.
5. Our culture is happy to fill the church's silence.
   * Ephesians 5:11-13 - "Shameful to even speak of it" - not 100% literal. We cannot be silent.
   * Shame versus guilt. Shame often is felt when something happens TO us. Guilt often is felt when we DO something.
   * DNOW example: sin, secrets, and shame.
   * Anger is not the opposite of silence.
