### Dr. Robinson
* A truth discovered is more compelling than a truth told.

### Dr. Hambrick
* Counseling is only as effective as you are honest.
* We don't know what we know.
* You don't want to be self-centered in a way that you disclose a selfish act.
   * This is why false love and true betrayal can be studied in tandem.
* You are never more free than you are honest.
* I need to protect my wife from others, but also from MYSELF. My harsh words will hurt more than anyone else's. Good word here.
