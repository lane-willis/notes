## Counseling and Restorative Church Discipline

### Introduction and Pre-Stage One Church Discipline
* See Google Doc for Church Discipline shared with us. Download this.
   * Church discipline was becoming elder discipline at Summit.
   * It was also taking so much of the elder's time when they got involved.
   * Write policy as a letter to make it more personal.
      * Church Discipline policy written as a letter to the recipient of discipline.
* Make sure that receiving church discipline is not the first time they hear about church discipline.
   * Put church discipline in the church membership process/course.
   * Many people may not have a category for this.
* This process is meant to be restorative.
* The consequences (Church Membership) are chosen by the member.
   * In that sense, the conclusion of this process – if the concern proves to be valid – *will be chosen by you, not the church,* on the basis of whether you choose to repent of your sin and actively pursue a holy life.
* Matthew 18:15-20

#### Pre-Stage One: Confession
* *Before* it is the responsibility of another believer to address an area of sin in your life, it is your responsibility to confess sin and seek change (James 5:16). As a member of a church, you are to view the awareness and support of your fellow believers as a protection from God, not an invasion of privacy.
* Most things for church discipline can be hidden and grow over time.
   * This means the agency and responsibility is on the individual believer.
* To whom have you made these sins known for accountability and change? Could they be part of the restoration team?
* How have you sought to hide the presence/growth of these sins?
   * Reference to David and Bathsheba and how Scripture spends more time on hiding the sin than the sin itself.
   * You are never going to be free when you have access to that sinful choice.
   * Is this accurate? Is this complete?
* Who have you lied to or hidden from during the growth of your sin?
   * These will be people in need of care.

### Stages One to Three Church Discipline

#### Stage One: Individual Confrontation
* When one believer sees another believer living in sin it is their duty to lovingly and humbly bring this concern to the attention of their friend. Even if done imperfectly, who has raised concerns about this area of sin? Do you believe these individuals are willing to be a part of your restoration process/team?
   * How did the conversation go?
   * What efforts were made to change?
   * What did repentance look like?
   * Adultery and nanny found out example. Nanny confronted and was fired. How did you respond? What did you tell your family about why you fired the nanny?

#### Stage Two: Collective Confrontation
* Reviewing this document with an elder is evidence that you are, at least potentially, at this stage of church discipline. We want you to know that this is called "church" discipline process for a reason; it involves the church. In the plan that we will develop WITH (not for) you in the pages that follow, we will be involving more than the elder team because your restoration should be worked out in your community.

#### Stage Three: Church-Wide Confrontation
* You need to understand that if you are unwilling to profess your need for the gospel and actively engage in removing these sins we will – as an act of love – call on the larger church (your campus) to relate to you as your life indicates that God sees you; that is, as an unsaved individual whom God loves but is not a part of his covenant family – a non-Christian.
   * This is not what we desire, but your response to the first stage of God’s protection (either by resistance, passivity, or hiding your sin) leads us to believe it is appropriate to warn you of the implication of continued persistence in your sin.
   * This is the announcement from pulpit stage. Probably done at member meeting. Discontinue fellowship here.
   * **This is how far you would get in conversation 1.**
